# Henry Bot
HenryBot is a fun interactive bot for groupchats in telegram. The bot will respond to any triggers that are added, with the given responses. His triggers can be seen by issuing the `/triggers` command, while commands can be added with the `/add` command. 

Henry's triggers are global, meaning that you can see the triggers of other chats and the other way around. One might argue this has its drawbacks, but I would argue that it creates some hilarious situations. HenryBot supports all unicode characters, among which are emojis, greek letters and different fonts. 

This bot can be found on [telegram](https://t.me/HenryBot).
